# Mental_Health

This is the repo for mental health related projects, beginning with one between me and my colleague Weiqi "Vicky" Liang. We examined whether income influences happines, by looking at proxies such as suicide rates. We could consider use of therapy, but that could introdice bias in that wealthier people may have more access to therapy.
