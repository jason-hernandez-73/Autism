# Mental_Health

This is the repo for mental health related projects, beginning with one between me and my colleague Weiqi "Vicky" Liang. We examined the potential ways in which mental illness impacts income, unsing the Kaggle dataset https://www.kaggle.com/michaelacorley/unemployment-and-mental-illness-survey

Vicky looked at mental illness as the predicted variable, whereas I looked at household income. As it turns out, household income is not very predictable; even narrowing it down to just the most relevant columns still resulted in little predictive power. Interestingly, the education cilumn in this data set is not representative of the population at large -- a far higher percentage of these respondents had completed a bachelor's degree than in the general population. Yet education was not a good predictor of any other factor in the dateset -- not of income, not of welfare, not of mental health. The only highly correlated data relative to factors likely to affect income was the obvious: mental illness, disability, and welfare all predicted against being employed!
