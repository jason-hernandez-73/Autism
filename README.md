# Autism

by Jason Hernandez

This project is special to me because I am autistic. Back in the 1970s when I was a kid, autism was not as well understood as it is today. The interventions autistic kids get today -- IEP, OT -- I never had. I am still living with the repercussions today: big gaps in employment, still in early-career jobs, never was good at anything besides academics. Autistic kids today have a chance at better outcomes with early diagnosis and the right inerventions.
