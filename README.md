# Autism

by Jason Hernandez

This project is special to me because I am autistic. Back in the 1970s when I was a kid, autism was not as well understood as it is today. The interventions autistic kids get today -- IEP, OT -- I never had. I am still living with the repercussions today: big gaps in employment, still in early-career jobs, never was good at anything besides academics. Autistic kids today have a chance at better outcomes with early diagnosis and the right inerventions.

The DSM-IV is no longer current, but is was when the ABIDE dataset was produced. At this URL https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213158217302073 is a research paper in which the ABIDE dataset was used with deep learning to identify Autism Spectrum Disorder. In this project, we use the same dataset to try to do something similar.
